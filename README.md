# simplegame
A simple rpg style game using javascript alerts.

Enter your name and choose a class (each class will have a special skill):

Wizard
Knight
Paladin
Rogue
Thief
Cleric

Then you will be given a base health and armor and will encounter a random enemy from the list below:

Troll
Witch
Snake King
Eye Ball
Cyclops
Zombie
Dragon

You can choose to have the computer randomize your moves or to allow you to pick your moves. The battle begins. You will attack the enemy and take some of it's health. Sometimes you or the enemy will block the attack allowing you or them to counterattack. Sometimes randomly you or the enemy will get a critical hit which increases the damage your next attack will bring. Occasionally, you will get to use your special move on the enemy, whether stealing its health or giving extra damage. When your armor health is decreased to 0 you will lose your armor and any following attack on you will decrease your main health bar. The battle ends when you defeat the monster by bringing it's health down to 0 or it does the same to you and you die. Enjoy the slightly addicting outcomes!
